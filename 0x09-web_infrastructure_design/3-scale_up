I have incorporated an additional server and load balancer for each new component introduced. By integrating the new server, we have achieved the separation of individual components such as the web server (Nginx), application server (code base), and database (MySQL) onto their respective servers. This setup ensures redundancy by having an extra server housing all the components, ready to take over in case of component or server failure. Each server is actively monitored and equipped with a firewall for enhanced security. Furthermore, an extra load balancer has been included to efficiently distribute traffic across the entire infrastructure, enabling better handling of increased user activity. The additional component (API GATEWAY) is a solution to eliminate the bottleneck from calling different APIs for each server. It encapsulates all APIs from the server into one acting like an API proxy and router calling each API according to the request given.
